In this game the user will provide me with a number 1-25. 
After this number is provided, that will correlate to a animal in a list I created.
I will then provide the player with underscores that correlate to how many letters are in this word.
The player will then input a character and everytime they guess correctly I will show them where the letter(s) are in the word.
If they incorrectly guess they will get a body part added to the "hangman".
The player wins if he/she guesses the word before the hangman is hanged.
If the picture is completed of the hangman before they correctly guess the word, the player loses.
